# OSM admin boundaries extractor

This project is inspired by OSM community and such tools as Mapzen Borders(https://mapzen.com/data/borders/), 
Postgis geometry simplification https://strk.kbt.io/blog/tag/postgis/ and many others. It is aimed to extract and
simplify borders of multiple administrative levels from OSM data.
